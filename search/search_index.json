Its major features include: automatic type conversion between PHP and XML-RPC a server proxy object (to simplify method resolution) access to server introspection capabilities Method Calls The constructor of Zend\\XmlRpc\\Client receives the URL of the remote XML-RPC server endpoint as its first parameter. The new instance returned may be used to call any number of remote methods at that endpoint. To call a remote method with the XML-RPC client, instantiate it and use the call() instance method. The code sample below uses a demonstration XML-RPC server from Advogato . You can use it for testing or exploring the Zend\\XmlRpc components. XML-RPC Method Call $client = new Zend\\XmlRpc\\Client('http://www.advogato.org/XMLRPC'); var_dump($client->call('test.guess')); // ['You guessed', 42] The XML-RPC value returned from the remote method call will be automatically unmarshaled and cast to the equivalent PHP native type. In the example above, a PHP array is returned containing a string and an integer value; you can immediately use the returned value. The first parameter of the call() method receives the name of the remote method to call. If the remote method requires any parameters, these can be sent by supplying a second, optional parameter to call() with an array of values to pass to the remote method: XML-RPC Method Call with Parameters $client = new Zend\\XmlRpc\\Client('http://www.advogato.org/XMLRPC'); $arg1 = 5; $arg2 = 7; $result = $client->call('test.sumProd', [$arg1, $arg2]); // $result is a native PHP type If the remote method doesn't require parameters, this optional parameter may either be left out or an empty [] passed to it. The array of parameters for the remote method can contain native PHP types, Zend\\XmlRpc\\Value objects, or a mix of each. The call() method will automatically convert the XML-RPC response and return its equivalent PHP native type. A Zend\\XmlRpc\\Response object for the return value will also be available by calling the getLastResponse() method after the call. Types and Conversions Some remote method calls require parameters. These are given to the call() method of Zend\\XmlRpc\\Client as an array in the second parameter. Each parameter may be given as either a native PHP type which will be automatically converted, or as an object representing a specific XML-RPC type (one of the Zend\\XmlRpc\\Value objects). PHP Native Types as Parameters Parameters may be passed to call() as native PHP variables, meaning as a string , integer , float , boolean , array , or an object . In this case, each PHP native type will be auto-detected and converted into one of the XML-RPC types according to this table: PHP Native Type XML-RPC Type integer int Zend\\Math\\BigInteger\\BigInteger i8 double double boolean boolean string string null nil array array associative array struct object array DateTime dateTime.iso8601 DateTime dateTime.iso8601 What type do empty arrays get cast to? Passing an empty array to an XML-RPC method is problematic, as it could represent either an array or a struct. Zend\\XmlRpc\\Client detects such conditions and makes a request to the server's system.methodSignature method to determine the appropriate XML-RPC type to cast to. However, this in itself can lead to issues. First off, servers that do not support system.methodSignature will log failed requests, and Zend\\XmlRpc\\Client will resort to casting the value to an XML-RPC array type. Additionally, this means that any call with array arguments will result in an additional call to the remote server. To disable the lookup entirely, you can call the setSkipSystemLookup() method prior to making your XML-RPC call: $client-setSkipSystemLookup(true); $result = $client-call('foo.bar', array(array())); Zend\\XmlRpc\\Value Objects as Parameters Parameters may also be created as Zend\\XmlRpc\\Value instances to specify an exact XML-RPC type. The primary reasons for doing this are: When you want to make sure the correct parameter type is passed to the procedure (i.e. the procedure requires an integer and you may get it from a database as a string) When the procedure requires base64 or dateTime.iso8601 type (which doesn't exists as a PHP native type) When auto-conversion may fail (i.e. you want to pass an empty XML-RPC struct as a parameter. Empty structs are represented as empty arrays in PHP but, if you give an empty array as a parameter it will be auto-converted to an XML-RPC array since it's not an associative array) There are two ways to create a Zend\\XmlRpc\\Value object: instantiate one of the Zend\\XmlRpc\\Value subclasses directly, or use the static factory method Zend\\XmlRpc\\AbstractValue::getXmlRpcValue() .

The PHP type will be converted to the specified type using PHP casting. For example, if a string is given as a value to the Zend\\XmlRpc\\Value\\Integer object, it will be converted using (int) $value . Server Proxy Object Another way to call remote methods with the XML-RPC client is to use the server proxy. This is a PHP object that proxies a remote XML-RPC namespace, making it work as close to a native PHP object as possible. To instantiate a server proxy, call the getProxy() instance method of Zend\\XmlRpc\\Client . This will return an instance of Zend\\XmlRpc\\Client\\ServerProxy . Any method call on the server proxy object will be forwarded to the remote, and parameters may be passed like any other PHP method. Proxy the Default Namespace $client = new Zend\\XmlRpc\\Client('http://www.advogato.org/XMLRPC'); $service = $client->getProxy(); // Proxy the default namespace $products = $service->test->sumProd(5, 7); // test.sumProd(5, 7) returns [12, 35] The getProxy() method receives an optional argument specifying which namespace of the remote server to proxy. If it does not receive a namespace, the default namespace will be proxied. In the next example, the 'test' namespace will be proxied: Proxy Any Namespace $client = new Zend\\XmlRpc\\Client('http://www.advogato.org/XMLRPC'); $test = $client->getProxy('test'); // Proxy the \"test\" namespace $hello = $test->sumProd(5, 7); // test.sumProd(5, 7) returns [12, 35] If the remote server supports nested namespaces of any depth, these can also be used through the server proxy. For example, if the server in the example above had a method test.foo.bar() , it could be called as $test->foo->bar() . Error Handling Two kinds of errors can occur during an XML-RPC method call: HTTP errors and XML-RPC faults. Zend\\XmlRpc\\Client recognizes each and provides the ability to detect and trap them independently. HTTP Errors If any HTTP error occurs, such as the remote HTTP server returns a 404 Not Found , a Zend\\XmlRpc\\Client\\Exception\\HttpException will be thrown. Handling HTTP Errors $client = new Zend\\XmlRpc\\Client('http://foo/404'); try { $client->call('bar', array($arg1, $arg2)); } catch (Zend\\XmlRpc\\Client\\Exception\\HttpException $e) { // $e->getCode() returns 404 // $e->getMessage() returns \"Not Found\" } Regardless of how the XML-RPC client is used, the Zend\\XmlRpc\\Client\\Exception\\HttpException will be thrown whenever an HTTP error occurs. XML-RPC Faults An XML-RPC fault is analogous to a PHP exception. It is a special type returned from an XML-RPC method call that has both an error code and an error message. XML-RPC faults are handled differently depending on the context of how the Zend\\XmlRpc\\Client is used. When the call() method or the server proxy object is used, an XML-RPC fault will result in a Zend\\XmlRpc\\Client\\Exception\\FaultException being thrown. The code and message of the exception will map directly to their respective values in the original XML-RPC fault response. Handling XML-RPC Faults $client = new Zend\\XmlRpc\\Client('http://www.advogato.org/XMLRPC'); try { $client->call('badMethod'); } catch (Zend\\XmlRpc\\Client\\Exception\\FaultException $e) { // $e->getCode() returns 1 // $e->getMessage() returns \"Unknown method\" } When the call() method is used to make the request, the Zend\\XmlRpc\\Client\\Exception\\FaultException will be thrown on fault. A Zend\\XmlRpc\\Response object containing the fault will also be available by calling getLastResponse() . When the doRequest() method is used to make the request, it will not throw the exception. Instead, it will return a Zend\\XmlRpc\\Response object that, on error, contains the fault. This can be checked with isFault() instance method of Zend\\XmlRpc\\Response . Server Introspection Some XML-RPC servers support the de facto introspection methods under the XML-RPC system. namespace. Zend\\XmlRpc\\Client provides special support for servers with these capabilities. A Zend\\XmlRpc\\Client\\ServerIntrospection instance may be retrieved by calling the getIntrospector() method of Zend\\XmlRpc\\Client . It can then be used to perform introspection operations on the server. $client = new Zend\\XmlRpc\\Client('http://example.com/xmlrpcserver.php'); $introspector = $client->getIntrospector(); foreach ($introspector->listMethods() as $method) { echo \"Method: \" . $method . \"\\n\"; } The following methods are available for introspection: getSignatureForEachMethod : Returns the signature for each method on the server. getSignatureForEachMethodByMulticall($methods=null) : Attempt to get the method signatures in one request via system.multicall . Optionally pass an array of method names. getSignatureForEachMethodByLooping($methods=null) : Get the method signatures for every method by successively calling system.methodSignature . Optionally pass an array of method names getMethodSignature($method) : Get the method's signature for $method . listMethods : List all methods on the server. From Request to Response Under the hood, the call() instance method of Zend\\XmlRpc\\Client builds a request object ( Zend\\XmlRpc\\Request ) and sends it to another method, doRequest() , that returns a response object ( Zend\\XmlRpc\\Response ). The doRequest() method is also available for use directly. Processing Request to Response $client = new Zend\\XmlRpc\\Client('http://www.advogato.org/XMLRPC'); $request = new Zend\\XmlRpc\\Request(); $request->setMethod('test.guess'); $client->doRequest($request); // $client->getLastRequest() returns instanceof Zend\\XmlRpc\\Request // $client->getLastResponse() returns instanceof Zend\\XmlRpc\\Response Whenever an XML-RPC method call is made by the client through any means \u2014 either the call() method, doRequest() method, or server proxy \u2014 the last request object and its resultant response object will always be available through the methods getLastRequest() and getLastResponse() respectively. HTTP Client and Testing In all of the prior examples, an HTTP client was never specified. When this is the case, a new instance of Zend\\Http\\Client will be created with its default options and used by Zend\\XmlRpc\\Client automatically. The HTTP client can be retrieved at any time with the getHttpClient() method. For most cases, the default HTTP client will be sufficient. However, the setHttpClient() method allows for a different HTTP client instance to be injected. The setHttpClient() is particularly useful for unit testing. When combined with Zend\\Http\\Client\\Adapter\\Test , remote services can be mocked out for testing. See the unit tests for Zend\\XmlRpc\\Client for examples of how to do this.","title":"XML-RPC Clients"},{"location":"client/#xml-rpc-clients","text":"zend-xmlrpc provides support for consuming remote XML-RPC services as a client via the Zend\\XmlRpc\\Client class.

Additionally, it implements the system.multicall() method, allowing boxcarring of requests. Basic Usage $server = new Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server(); $server->setClass('My\\Service\\Class'); echo $server->handle(); Server Structure Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server is composed of a variety of components, ranging from the server itself to request, response, and fault objects. To bootstrap Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server , the developer must attach one or more classes or functions to the server, via the setClass() and addFunction() methods. Once done, you may either pass a Zend\\XmlRpc\\Request object to Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server::handle() , or it will instantiate a Zend\\XmlRpc\\Request\\Http object if none is provided, thus grabbing the request from php://input . Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server::handle() then attempts to dispatch to the appropriate handler based on the method requested. It then returns either a Zend\\XmlRpc\\Response -based object or a Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server\\Fault object. These objects both have __toString() methods that create valid XML-RPC XML responses, allowing them to be directly echoed. Anatomy of a webservice General considerations For maximum performance it is recommended to use a simple bootstrap file for the server component. Using Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server inside a Zend\\Mvc\\Controller is strongly discouraged to avoid the overhead. Services change over time and while webservices are generally less change intense as code-native APIs, it is recommended to version your service. Do so to lay grounds to provide compatibility for clients using older versions of your service and manage your service lifecycle including deprecation timeframes. To do so just include a version number into your URI. It is also recommended to include the remote protocol name in the URI to allow easy integration of upcoming remoting technologies. http://myservice.ws/1.0/XMLRPC/ . What to expose? Most of the time it is not sensible to expose business objects directly. Business objects are usually small and under heavy change, because change is cheap in this layer of your application. Once deployed and adopted, web services are hard to change. Another concern is I/O and latency: the best webservice calls are those not happening. Therefore service calls need to be more coarse-grained than usual business logic is. Often an additional layer in front of your business objects makes sense. This layer is sometimes referred to as Remote Facade . Such a service layer adds a coarse grained interface on top of your business logic and groups verbose operations into smaller ones. Conventions Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server allows the developer to attach functions and class method calls as dispatchable XML-RPC methods. Via Zend\\Server\\Reflection , it does introspection on all attached methods, using the function and method docblocks to determine the method help text and method signatures. XML-RPC types do not necessarily map one-to-one to PHP types. However, the code will do its best to guess the appropriate type based on the values listed in @param and @return annotations. Some XML-RPC types have no immediate PHP equivalent, however, and should be hinted using the XML-RPC type in the PHPDoc. These include: dateTime.iso8601 , a string formatted as ' YYYYMMDDTHH:mm:ss ' base64 , base64 encoded data struct , any associative array An example of how to hint follows: /** * This is a sample function * * @param base64 $val1 Base64-encoded data * @param dateTime.iso8601 $val2 An ISO date * @param struct $val3 An associative array * @return struct */ function myFunc($val1, $val2, $val3) { } PhpDocumentor does not validate types specified for params or return values, so this will have no impact on your API documentation. Providing the hinting is necessary, however, when the server is validating the parameters provided to the method call. It is perfectly valid to specify multiple types for both params and return values; the XML-RPC specification even suggests that system.methodSignature should return an array of all possible method signatures (i.e., all possible combinations of param and return values). You may do so just as you normally would with PhpDocumentor, using the | operator: /** * This is a sample function * * @param string|base64 $val1 String or base64-encoded data * @param string|dateTime.iso8601 $val2 String or an ISO date * @param array|struct $val3 Normal indexed array or an associative array * @return boolean|struct */ function myFunc($val1, $val2, $val3) { } Use multiple values sparingly Allowing multiple signatures can lead to confusion for developers using the services; to keep things simple, a XML-RPC service method should typically only present a single signature. Utilizing Namespaces XML-RPC allows grouping related methods under dot-delimited namespaces . This helps prevent naming collisions between methods served by different classes. As an example, the XML-RPC server is expected to server several methods in the system namespace: system.listMethods system.methodHelp system.methodSignature Internally, these map to the methods of the same name in Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server . If you want to add namespaces to the methods you serve, simply provide a namespace to the appropriate method when attaching a function or class: // All public methods in My\\Service\\Class will be accessible as // myservice.METHODNAME $server->setClass('My\\Service\\Class', 'myservice'); // Function 'somefunc' will be accessible as funcs.somefunc $server->addFunction('somefunc', 'funcs'); Custom Request Objects Most of the time, you'll simply use the default request type included with Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server , Zend\\XmlRpc\\Request\\Http . However, there may be times when you need XML-RPC to be available via the CLI, a GUI, or other environment, or want to log incoming requests. To do so, you may create a custom request object that extends Zend\\XmlRpc\\Request . The most important thing to remember is to ensure that the getMethod() and getParams() methods are implemented so that the XML-RPC server can retrieve that information in order to dispatch the request. Custom Responses Similar to request objects, Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server can return custom response objects; by default, a Zend\\XmlRpc\\Response\\Http object is returned, which sends an appropriate Content-Type HTTP header for use with XML-RPC. Possible uses of a custom object would be to log responses, or to send responses back to STDOUT . To use a custom response class, use Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server::setResponseClass() prior to calling handle() . Handling Exceptions via Faults Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server catches Exceptions generated by a dispatched method, and generates an XML-RPC fault response when such an exception is caught. By default, however, the exception messages and codes are not used in a fault response. This is an intentional decision to protect your code; many exceptions expose more information about the code or environment than a developer would necessarily intend (a prime example includes database exceptions). Exception classes can be whitelisted to be used as fault responses, however. To do so, call Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server\\Fault::attachFaultException() and pass an exception class to whitelist: Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server\\Fault::attachFaultException('My\\Project\\Exception'); If you utilize an exception class that your other project exceptions inherit, you can then whitelist a whole family of exceptions at a time. Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server\\Exception s are always whitelisted, to allow reporting specific internal errors (undefined methods, etc.). Any exception not specifically whitelisted will generate a fault response with a code of '404' and a message of 'Unknown error'. Caching Server Definitions Between Requests Attaching many classes to an XML-RPC server instance can utilize a lot of resources; each class must introspect using the Reflection API (via Zend\\Server\\Reflection ), which in turn generates a list of all possible method signatures to provide to the server class. To reduce this performance hit somewhat, Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server\\Cache can be used to cache the server definition between requests. An sample usage follows: use My\\Service as s; use Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server as XmlRpcServer; $cacheFile = dirname(__FILE__) . '/xmlrpc.cache'; $server = new XmlRpcServer(); if (! XmlRpcServer\\Cache::get($cacheFile, $server)) { $server->setClass(s\\Glue::class, 'glue'); // glue. namespace $server->setClass(s\\Paste::class, 'paste'); // paste. namespace $server->setClass(s\\Tape::class, 'tape'); // tape. namespace XmlRpcServer\\Cache::save($cacheFile, $server); } echo $server->handle(); The above example attempts to retrieve a server definition from xmlrpc.cache in the same directory as the script. If unsuccessful, it loads the service classes it needs, attaches them to the server instance, and then attempts to create a new cache file with the server definition. Usage Examples Below are several usage examples, showing the full spectrum of options available to developers. Usage examples will each build on the previous example provided. Basic Usage The example below attaches a function as a dispatchable XML-RPC method and handles incoming calls. /** * Return the MD5 sum of a value * * @param string $value Value to md5sum * @return string MD5 sum of value */ function md5Value($value) { return md5($value); } $server = new Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server(); $server->addFunction('md5Value'); echo $server->handle(); Attaching a class The example below illustrates attaching a class' public methods as dispatchable XML-RPC methods. require_once 'Services/Comb.php'; $server = new Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server(); $server->setClass('Services\\Comb'); echo $server->handle(); Attaching a class with arguments The following example illustrates how to attach a class' public methods and passing arguments to its methods. This can be used to specify certain defaults when registering service classes. namespace Services; class PricingService { /** * Calculate current price of product with $productId * * @param ProductRepository $productRepository * @param PurchaseRepository $purchaseRepository * @param integer $productId */ public function calculate( ProductRepository $productRepository, PurchaseRepository $purchaseRepository, $productId ) { /* ... */ } } $server = new Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server(); $server->setClass( 'Services\\PricingService', 'pricing', new ProductRepository(), new PurchaseRepository() ); The arguments passed to setClass() are injected into the method call pricing.calculate() on remote invocation. In the example above, only the argument $productId is expected from the client. Passing arguments only to constructor Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server allows providing constructor arguments when specifying classes, instead of when invoking methods. To limit injection to constructors, call sendArgumentsToAllMethods and pass FALSE as an argument. This disables the default behavior of all arguments being injected into the remote method. In the example below, the instance of ProductRepository and PurchaseRepository is only injected into the constructor of Services\\PricingService2 . class Services\\PricingService2 { /** * @param ProductRepository $productRepository * @param PurchaseRepository $purchaseRepository */ public function __construct( ProductRepository $productRepository, PurchaseRepository $purchaseRepository ) { /* ... */ } /** * Calculate current price of product with $productId * * @param integer $productId * @return double */ public function calculate($productId) { ... } } $server = new Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server(); // Tell the server to pass arguments to constructors instead of at invocation: $server->sendArgumentsToAllMethods(false); // Map the class: $server->setClass( 'Services\\PricingService2', 'pricing', new ProductRepository(), new PurchaseRepository() ); Attaching a class instance setClass() allows registering a previously instantiated class with the server, instead of specifying the class name. Obviously, passing arguments to the constructor is not possible with pre-instantiated classes. Attaching several classes using namespaces The example below illustrates attaching several classes, each with their own namespace. use Services as s; use Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server as XmlRpcServer; $server = new XmlRpcServer(); $server->setClass(s\\Comb::class, 'comb'); // methods called as comb.* $server->setClass(s\\Brush::class, 'brush'); // methods called as brush.* $server->setClass(s\\Pick::class, 'pick'); // methods called as pick.* echo $server->handle(); Specifying exceptions to use as valid fault responses The example below allows any Services\\Exception -derived class to report its code and message in the fault response. use Services as s; use Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server as XmlRpcServer; use Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server\\Fault as XmlRpcFault; // Allow Services_Exceptions to report as fault responses XmlRpcFault::attachFaultException(s\\Exception::class); $server = new XmlRpcServer(); $server->setClass(s\\Comb::class, 'comb'); // methods called as comb.* $server->setClass(s\\Brush::class, 'brush'); // methods called as brush.* $server->setClass(s\\Pick::class, 'pick'); // methods called as pick.* echo $server->handle(); Utilizing custom request and response objects Some use cases require custom request objects; XML-RPC is not bound to HTTP as a transfer protocol. It is possible to use other transfer protocols like SSH or telnet to send the request and response data over the wire. Another use case is authentication and authorization. When a different transfer protocol is required, you will need to change the implementation to read request data. The example below instantiates a custom request class and passes it to the server to handle. use Services as s; use Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server as XmlRpcServer; use Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server\\Fault as XmlRpcFault; // Allow Services_Exceptions to report as fault responses XmlRpcFault::attachFaultException(s\\Exception::class); $server = new XmlRpcServer(); $server->setClass(s\\Comb::class, 'comb'); // methods called as comb.* $server->setClass(s\\Brush::class, 'brush'); // methods called as brush.* $server->setClass(s\\Pick::class, 'pick'); // methods called as pick.* // Create a request object $request = new s\\Request(); echo $server->handle($request); Specifying a custom response class The example below illustrates specifying a custom response class for the returned response. use Services as s; use Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server as XmlRpcServer; use Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server\\Fault as XmlRpcFault; // Allow Services_Exceptions to report as fault responses XmlRpcFault::attachFaultException(s\\Exception::class); $server = new XmlRpcServer(); $server->setClass(s\\Comb::class, 'comb'); // methods called as comb.* $server->setClass(s\\Brush::class, 'brush'); // methods called as brush.* $server->setClass(s\\Pick::class, 'pick'); // methods called as pick.* // Create a request object $request = new s\\Request(); // Utilize a custom response $server->setResponseClass(s\\Response::class); echo $server->handle($request); Performance optimization Cache server definitions between requests The example below illustrates caching server definitions between requests. use Services as s; use Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server as XmlRpcServer; use Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server\\Fault as XmlRpcFault; // Specify a cache file $cacheFile = dirname(__FILE__) . '/xmlrpc.cache'; // Allow Services\\Exceptions to report as fault responses XmlRpcFault::attachFaultException(s\\Exception::class); $server = new XmlRpcServer(); // Attempt to retrieve server definition from cache if (! XmlRpcServer\\Cache::get($cacheFile, $server)) { $server->setClass(s\\Comb::class, 'comb'); // methods called as comb.* $server->setClass(s\\Brush::class, 'brush'); // methods called as brush.* $server->setClass(s\\Pick::class, 'pick'); // methods called as pick.* // Save cache XmlRpcServer\\Cache::save($cacheFile, $server); } // Create a request object $request = new s\\Request(); // Utilize a custom response $server->setResponseClass(s\\Response::class); echo $server->handle($request); Cache file location The server cache file should be located outside the document root. Optimizing XML generation Zend\\XmlRpc\\Server uses DOMDocument to generate it's XML output. While this functionality is available on most hosts, it's not always the most performant solution; benchmarks have shown that XmlWriter performs better. If ext/xmlwriter is available on your host, you can select the XmlWriter -based generator to leverage the performance differences. use Zend\\XmlRpc; XmlRpc\\AbstractValue::setGenerator(new XmlRpc\\Generator\\XmlWriter()); $server = new XmlRpc\\Server(); Benchmark your application Performance is determined by many parameters, and benchmarks only apply for the specific test case. Differences come from PHP version, installed extensions, webserver, and operating system just to name a few. Please make sure to benchmark your application on your own and decide which generator to use based on your numbers. Benchmark your client Optimization makes sense for the client side too.
